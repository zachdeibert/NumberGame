			<h5>
				Set-up
			</h5>
			<p>
				You will see a list of people who are currently connected to the server and are not currently playing a game on the right side of the lobby.
				If you want to start a game, you can select people's names to add them to your new game.
				Each game must have at least three people.
				Also, you will be able to change the size of the game on the left side of the lobby.
				The size must not be less than two or greater than sixteen.
				Under the size box, there is a list of people in your new game in the order their turns will be.
				Each of those people you select will be added to your game immediately after you press the start button.
			</p>
			<h5>
				Playing the Game
			</h5>
			<p>
				An indicator will show at the top of your screen when it is your turn.
				Also, in the list of players in your game on the right of the screen, the person whose turn it is will be italicized.
				When it is your turn, you can select a row on the triangle to modify, then you will see numerous text boxes appear at the bottom of your screen.
				You can adjust these values, then press the take turn button to sumbit your turn.
				Then, it will be the next person's turn and you will see your changes appear on the triangle.
				Each box must be greater than or equal to zero, and you cannot increase the values on the triangle.
			</p>
			<h5>
				Ending the Game
			</h5>
			<p>
				The game ends when one of two things occur.
				Either all players except one will be out or all of the tiles on the triangle will become zero.
				Any players still in the game will receive points for winning.
				After this, you will be returned to the lobby where you can start a new game.
			</p>
			<h5>
				Ways to Get Out
			</h5>
			<p>
				There are two ways to get out.
				Either you can remove the last tile on the board with a one, or you can remove the last tile on the board with a number greater than one.
				However, if you remove the tile with a one, then another players lowers a number greater than one to a one, you will be revived.
				Because of this, you must make sure to stay in the game for the entire game and not leave after you become out.
